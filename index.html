            In my words bullying is a form of harassment, verbal and physical.
            Sometimes leading to self doubt, depression and suicide as the bullying
            continues. Bullies use hurtful words and actions on purpose to discourage others.
            Anyone can get bullied, even adults and anyone can be a bully. In some cases,
            the bullies are stressed or angry and don't know how to express it. Making
            someone else suffer with them. In my point of view, insults are considered
            bullying. Even the little things hurt a lot. It's hard to understand what the bully is
            going though, we all just assume that they are disrespectful. When most of the
            time, they were hurting too.
            An example of bullying was when my friend got shamed because of her
            body size. I didn't know about it until later on. I know it has happened multiple
            times and I have witnessed it. I'm not proud of being a bystander, being honest I
            was scared of standing up and getting bullied myself. We don't always recognize
            bullying, sometimes it's unnoticeable and other times it's right in front of us. It's
            challenging to get over words that come out of anyone's mouth, frequently you go
            days with thinking about it. My friend was hurt, I could tell. It's hard fixing
            someone's thoughts about them self, once something is said to make them think
            it.
            We can't stop all bullying, but we can prevent it from happening so often.
            Like I said, most of the time bullies just need someone to talk to. It's anger kept
            inside for so long they need someone to express that anger out on. I truly don't
            I
            1

            know all the reasons why someone would bully, but I do know anger is something
            that is hard to keep in. We can always get a school counselor to monitor kids
            behavior. Try to make kids know its okay to talk to someone about bullying. It's
            challenging to tell adults about what's happening, kids feel like they'll always get
            in trouble. So when it comes to telling an adult, it's not in option. Instead of being
            a bystander, there is always the option of being an upstander. Reporting bullying
            is always a way to stop bullying.
